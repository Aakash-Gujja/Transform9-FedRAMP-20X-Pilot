# Transform9's FedRAMP 20x Phase One Pilot Final Submission

## Transform9 Overview

Transform9 provides AI voice agent solutions for healthcare practices, helping them manage patient calls and automate workflows such as creating new appointments, confirming, canceling, rescheduling existing appointments, and leaving voicemails.


## CSP Approach
Our approach can be summarized with the following steps:

### 1. Lightwight Documentation
Document the implementation of KSIs using Paramify Cloud with the FedRAMP 20x validations set.
### 2. Key Security Indicators and Validations
Gather and upload evidence into Paramify Cloud for each KSI validation, using automation where possible.

### 3. Validate Evidence
Meet with 3PAO and have them review and validate evidence in Paramify Cloud.

### 4. Automate Machine-readable Package
Generate and publish our machine-readable package using Paramify Cloud.

### 5. 3PAO Review
3PAO reviews the package and adds attestation.

### 6. Continuous Reporting Indication
Either on-demand or per an automated schedule, a new package will be generated with the most current evidence.

### 7. Prototype for Continuous Reporting
It is anticipated that Paramify Cloud will allow for a shareable link that shows the KSI dashboard.

### 8. CSP Rationale and Summary
Summary of and rationale for the approach used to generate the machine-readable file, and evidence generation methods.

### 9. CSP Submission
Similar to the Continuous Reporting capability, the package will be available either with a viewable link or through the machine-readable package file with a friendly HTML viewer.

# Step-by-Step Details

## Step 1 - Lightweigth Documentation

Document the implementation of our KSIs using Paramify Cloud with the FedRAMP 20x validations set.

## Step 2 - Key Security Indicators and Validations

Gather and upload evidence into Pramify Cloud for each KSI validation, using automation where possible. Instructions and commands for each evidence object are included to provide context to the evidence process and resutls.

## Step 3 - Validate Evidence

Meet with 3PAO and have them review and validate evidence in Paramify Cloud. 3PAO can set Assurance steps/Results, Assurance Status, and leave notes or remarks

Transform9 is working with ControlCase as 3PAO for this FedRAMP 20X Assessment. The assesment report from ControlCase is available here: 

## Step 4 - Automated Machine Readable Package

Publish our machine-readable format package using Paramify Cloudâ€™s DocRobot capabilities. Though YAML is our current proposal, Transform9 can support OSCAL, JSON, or other common formats.

# Assessment File Structure

The machin-redable assessment file is a YAML filw with the following structure [Assessment Schema](machine-readable-package/schema.yaml)
