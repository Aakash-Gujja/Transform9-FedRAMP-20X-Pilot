                        services.

                        Hardening Transform9  for security while maintaining
                        functionality.

                        Enabling only essential ports, protocols, and services.

                        Ensuring associated accounts are secure and compliant.

                        Disabling non-essential functions, ports, protocols, and
                        services.

                        Adhering to the principle of least privilege for device

                        Manager

                        Content: Transform9  leverages @AWS Security Groups, a
                        FedRAMP 20x-compliant component, for network access
                        control.


                        End User Responsibility: The @DevOps Admin employs @AWS
                        Security Groups for boundary protection in Transform9 ,
                        limiting use to allowed ports, protocols, and services.
                        Traffic to Transform9  is directed through @Custom Load
                        Balancer, featuring two access points:

                        the Transform9  web interface, requiring valid
                        credentials,

                        Transform9 admin access from authorized devices, secured
                        with two-factor authentication via @IAM and @Google

                        Content: The @ISSO uses NIST SP 800-60, Vol. II to rank
                        Transform9  on confidentiality, integrity, and
                        availability. System categorization is determined by the
                        highest level from each C-I-A aspect, considering the
                        data types processed. This informs the selection of
                        control baselines and tailored control settings.

                        Content: The Transform9  @Configuration Management Plan
                        and baseline configurations are reviewed at least
                        annually for security impacts, especially when new
                        services are provisioned. All changes to the baseline
                        are tracked in @GitHub.

                        The @Configuration Management Plan covers changes
                        impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and
                        availability, including system updates and
                        hardware/software integrations. Tasks such as data
                        visualization and load balancing, focused on
                        observability and performance optimization, are excluded
                        from its scope.

                        configuration of Transform9  in @GitHub, as outlined in
                        the @Configuration Management Plan. This includes:

                        Hardening Transform9  for security while maintaining
                        functionality.

                        Enabling only essential ports, protocols, and services.

                        Ensuring associated accounts are secure and compliant.

                        Disabling non-essential functions, ports, protocols, and
                        services.

                        Adhering to the principle of least privilege for device
                        operations and access.

                        Content: Transform9  uses @AWS, a FedRAMP 20x-compliant
                        cloud component that meets data protection requirements.


                        End User Responsibility: All customer data uploaded to
                        Transform9  by the customer in @AWS are encrypted using
                        @KMS, with AES-256 keys while they are stored within the
                        environment. All disks that contain customer data are
                        encrypted using OS level encryption. All encryption
                        within the environment is done using a FIPS 140-2
                        validated module. The same encryption mechanisms are
                        applied to backup systems and data stores that contain
                        customer data.

                        Admin and @Developer analyze builds for vulnerabilities
                        using @Inspector. Security flaws trigger a ticket in
                        @GitHub for the @Developer to fix. Only approved builds
                        move to production. Remediation progress is monitored by
                        the @DevOps Admin.

                        Content: The Transform9  @Configuration Management Plan
                        and baseline configurations are reviewed at least
                        annually for security impacts, especially when new
                        services are provisioned. All changes to the baseline
                        are tracked in @GitHub.

                        The @Configuration Management Plan covers changes
                        impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and
                        availability, including system updates and
                        hardware/software integrations. Tasks such as data
                        visualization and load balancing, focused on
                        observability and performance optimization, are excluded
                        from its scope.

                        Content: Transform9 has a defined @Software Development
                        Life Cycle Process for software development on
                        Transform9 . The @Product Manager and @Developer review
                        product requirements and create user stories in @GitHub.

                        @Developer uses @GitHub for standard naming conventions,
                        creating branches, and running automated tests.

                        After coding is completed, the @Developer ensures that
                        the requirements are satisfied, attaches a code review
                        template, and marks it "under review." @Github Actions
                        automatically runs a suite of tests to ensure
                        Transform9  is working correctly.

                        The @DevOps Admin lead completes the final review of
                        changes and pushes them from staging to production. The
                        @DevOps Admin monitors the environment to ensure
                        Transform9  works correctly.

                        End User Responsibility: Transform9 backs up all
                        databases, including customer data, using real-time
                        incremental and daily full cycle backups across multiple
                        availability zones. Daily records are retained for at
                        least seven days to support rollback. In case of
                        failure, Transform9 has a manual switchover process to
                        ensure customer data availability.

                        weaknesses discovered during the exercise.

                        during the quarterly period between reviews, that
                        incident serves as training in lieu of the annual

                        email, as indicated in the @Incident Response Plan.
                        Incidents should be reported within 1 hour of discovery,
                        and the timeframes for different incident categories
                        (see table) should be followed, unless the data owner
                        specifies a more restrictive guidance.

                        @InfoSec Admin, @Operations Admin, and support
                        organizations.

                        Stakeholders receive an email from the @Incident
